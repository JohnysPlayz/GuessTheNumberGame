This is my first ever time using python, I will propably keep updating ts for a while, but not sure... Anyway here is a tutorial on how u will use it:
1. Download the code
2. Run it on the terminal
3. A windows will open.. enjoy!
   If Windows says that u cant run it cause you have no program to run it you have to download VS: https://code.visualstudio.com/
